Sequencing NP
===================

**Sequencing NP** is a sequence to sequence learning framework based on numpy. 
The key feature of this numpy-based version is simplicity.

### Dependency
1. Python >= 3.5 (please forget Python 2)
2. numpy >= 1.12

----------


It could be only used for inference. 
We could load the trained parameters to sequencing_np and infer without using any deep learning frameworks. 
For example, inferring on Android !

We write this framework for fun.
